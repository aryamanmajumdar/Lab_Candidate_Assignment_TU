For the Temple University Neuroeconomics and SDNL application

The required figures are all in the 'figures' folder.
They're both in JPEG and TIFF formats - JPEG for easy viewing
on GitHub, and TIFF to give you the raw image.

The 'individual' folder contains the individual effect plots.
The 'overall' folder contains bar plots showing the effect across subjects.

The 'overall_largerstderrs' folder contains the same bar plots, but
with a different calculation for standard errors - using all subjects
within a condition. This results in significant differences for some
figures where there were none in the original calculation; the reason
is that these stderr bars capture the overall effect size - i.e. they
might be valuable in predicting the trend for a sample, but doesn't speak
to the significance of the effect of individual subjects.
For that, just look at figures the 'overall' folder.
